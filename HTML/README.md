# HTML and CSS
- They are not a real <it>programming</it> langauge. :( 
    <strong>Why?</strong>: because, they are only presentational languages. Present the information, no need to have a logic. 
    
## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- Defines the structure and content of webpages.
- It is the raw data that the webpage is built of.
- Kind of the barebones (may not be the best word for it) i.e: texts, links, images, buttons are created in HTML.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- Styling part.

<strong>Thus</strong>;
 HTML puts informations on the page, the CSS styles it by assigning positions, colors, font and etc.

 ## JavaScript
 - It's the programming language that makes websites do stuff.
 - Allows us to change CSS and HTML elements. Make it more interactive...

# HTML in more depth
### Elements and Tags
 Most of the information is wrapped in openning and closing tags. Angle brackets `<>` are the indicators of tags and they inform browsers about the HTML elements.

 `<`: openning tag --> indicates the start of a HTML element.
 `<`: closing tag --> indicates the end of a HTML element.
 - The keywords, or letters express the type of the elements.

 <it> For example </it>, `<p> this is a paragraf </p>` 

 - Not all HTML elements have closing tags. Some of them are self-closing such as `<br>` and `<img>`.

 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#main_root">This mozilla article </a> lists a huge collection of HTML tags.

HTML elements have <strong> 3 parts</strong>;
        <ul>
          <li>openning tag </li>
          <li>content</li>
          <li>closing tag</li>
        </ul>

#### Some rule of thumbs
- when creating a webpage, it is a rule of thumb to name your html file as index.html 
- do not use `<b>` and `<i>`, use `<strong>` and `<em>` instead. 
- always create a folder for your;
<ul> 
<li>images</li>
<li>create a css folder</li>
<li>create a javascript folder</li>
</ul>
- use lowercase sytnax for all the folders,files and scripts.
- always avoid using space, you can use "-" instead.
