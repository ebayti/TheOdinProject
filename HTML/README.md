<h2> HTML and CSS</h2>
<p> They are not a real <em>programming</em> langauge. :( 
    <strong>Why?</strong>: because, they are only presentational languages. Present the information, no need to have a logic. 
    
<h2> HTML </h2>
<p> is the raw data that the webpage is built of. </p>
<p> Kind of the barebones (may not be the best word for it) i.e: texts, links, images, buttons are created in HTML.
</p>
<h2> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) </h2>
<p> Styling part.</p>

<strong>Thus</strong>;
 <p> puts informations on the page, the CSS styles it by assigning positions, colors, font and etc.
</p>
 <h2> JavaScript </h2>
 <p> It's the programming language that makes websites do stuff.</p>
 <p> Allows us to change CSS and HTML elements. Make it more interactive...
