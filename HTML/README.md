# HTML and CSS
- They are not a real <it>programming</it> langauge. :( 
    <strong>Why?</strong>: because, they are only presentational languages. Present the information, no need to have a logic. 
    
## HTML
- is the raw data that the webpage is built of.
- Kind of the barebones (may not be the best word for it) i.e: texts, links, images, buttons are created in HTML.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- Styling part.

<strong>Thus</strong>;
 HTML puts informations on the page, the CSS styles it by assigning positions, colors, font and etc.

 ## JavaScript
 - It's the programming language that makes websites do stuff.
 - Allows us to change CSS and HTML elements. Make it more interactive...
